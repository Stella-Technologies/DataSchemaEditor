        <h1>FAQ - JSON Schema Editor</h1>
        <h2>What is the JSON Schema Editor?</h2>
        <p>The JSON Schema Editor is a web-based tool developed by Stella Technologies, designed to facilitate the visualization, creation, and editing of JSON-based schemas, specifically tailored for the <a href="https://github.com/stellatechnologies/CyberDataSchema">Cyber Data Schema</a>. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with complex data structures, supporting the management and linkage of various data types within an intuitive graphical environment.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h2>How is the JSON Schema Editor Designed to Work with the Cyber Data Schema?</h2>
        <p>This editor is specifically optimized to handle the unique elements and relationships defined within the Cyber Data Schema. It allows users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Import schemas in a predefined JSON format.</li>
            <li>Create new tables, columns, and relationships visually.</li>
            <li>Edit details such as names, descriptions, and types directly through interactive forms.</li>
            <li>Position tables within a visual space to map out relationships and data flow effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>What Format Do Schemas Need to Be in for Importing?</h2>
        <p>To import data into the JSON Schema Editor, schemas need to be structured in the following JSON format:</p>
        <pre>{
            "version": "version of the cyber data schema",
            "release_date": "date of the release",
